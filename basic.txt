3.Z index
The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
6.Position
static
relative
fixed
absolute
sticky

 position: static;
An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:

 position: relative;
 Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to
 fit into any gap left by the element

 position: fixed;
          An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays 
          in the same place even if the page is scrolled

 position: absolute;

          An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor

 position: sticky;

           An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

            A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned
              relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place
